# GRN-Visualization
An interactive tool for visualizing gene regulatory networks.

The tool gives access to the [RegNetwork] (https://doi.org/10.1093/database/bav095) and [TRRUST] (https://doi.org/10.1038/srep11432) database for querying known regulatory links.
Users can add or remove new nodes/edges. 
We are currently working on adding more updated databases for cross-checking the links.
