# GRN-Visualization
An interactive tool for visualizing gene regulatory networks
The tool gives access to the RegNetwork and TRRUST database for querying known regulatory links.
Users can add or remove new nodes/edges. 
We are currently working on adding more updated databases for cross-checking the links.
